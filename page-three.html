    <h2>Abstract</h2><a id="section-two" />
    <p>
        <strong>Occupational Health and Safety (OHS)</strong> is an ongoing concern in Industrial operations, much especially in the Oil
        and Gas Industry. Therefore Safety in the workplace has assumed prime Importance in Oil and Gas Operations
        worldwide. In Canada, detailed legislation has been passed, which govern work procedures in a way that the
        safety of workersâ€™ lives and the environment is given top priority.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the light of the above, Safety in the Oil and Gas Industry is of utmost importance to anyone who will work in
        the Oil Industry, and also those who live in environments that surround Oil and Gas Operations. Safety Policies
        govern the length and breadth of all Oil and Gas Operations, from the Upstream to the downstream sectors. Safety
        as a lifestyle habit is considered <i>a non-negotiable characteristic</i> of Oil workers, as proper attention and
        careful attention often means the difference between life and death in the occurrence of workplace incidences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every single work package and task in the Industry does involve safety policies and guidelines that are
        inseparably welded into such tasks. It is therefore impossible to study to work in Oil and Gas without having a
        continuous learning program that updates workers of the changing trends in Occupational Health and Safety
        policies and practices, and how our actions as workers impact the environment positively or negatively. An
        integral part of OHS best practices involve Identifying, Assessing, and Controlling Hazards, if not altogether
        eliminating them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This report focuses mainly on the hazards associated with typical sour gas plants in Western Canada. Sour gases,
        which present the inevitable yet dangerous hazard of Sulphur Containing compounds, comprise part of the crude
        oil that is mined and processed in this part of the world. Special attention will be paid to assessing and
        responding to this and other various hazards presented in the Gas plant by specialized Safety services.
