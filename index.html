            <p>
                We have been instructed by Scott to create an html article web page. This is what we would use to build
                out
                a web artifact using other tools, like CSS, Javascript and others. This is really cool indeed!
            </p>
            <p>
                This, apparently <em>will continue on for the course of this program.</em> Most definitely, this page
                and
                article
                will get more robust and elegant, when we add more bells and whistles to what we are doing now. I am
                truly
                excited at how this will evolve into something we may have never encountered before. For now, permit me
                to
                practice the use of superscripts and subscripts in this way: The chemical formula for water is
                H<sub>2</sub>O; and 2<sup>3</sup> = 8. Now, how does that look?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>We’ve gone from having 21 elements in HTML tags, that first document, to having 100 more elements
                    now,
                    and yet it’s still the same language. I find that amazing. It’s still the same language that was
                    created
                    25 years ago. It’s grown an extra 100 elements in there, and yet it’s still the same language.</p>

            <h2>Class Takeaway Practice Oct 12</h2>
            <p>
                We shall continue on later to populate this field as further insights and inspiration is gained.Here go
                to
                the link <a href="https://github.com/ovokpus/ComIT-class-project" target="_blank">My website files on
                    github</a> for more details on this subject matter. The class on the 7th of October got pushed to
                October 12. What we have here going forward is a pilot attempt to fill in relevant content towards my
                project at the end of the program.
            </p>

            <h2>Class Takeaway Oct 14</h2>
            <p>
                We shall insert more content as time passes. We can try to create separate paragraphs by leaving a bunch
                of
                space in our HTML file, but that space doesn't count. The browser ignores it. All these words simply add
                up
                to a bunch of words in a row. The browser doesn't know what this is, because we haven't used any HTML
                yet to
                tell it what this is.
            </p>

            <h2>Class Takeaway future(TBD)</h2>
            <p>
                More content with time. If you just put all the content in an HTML file with no markup, it just ends up
                as
                one big blob on the website. The browser assumes it's all one long string of text.
            </p>

            <h3>What we have covered so far</h3>
            <p>
                In a nutshell, we have covered the following topics to date: How the Internet works, Developers Toolbox,
                browsers, Git, IDE, Github, Development tools, and, very importantly, <strong>an Introduction to
                    HTML.</strong> We also learnt that every HTML page must contain at least three(3) elements from the
                following: The doctype, html, head, and body elements.
