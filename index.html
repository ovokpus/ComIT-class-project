            We have been instructed by Scott to create an html article web page. This is what we would use to build out
            a web artifact using other tools, like CSS, Javascript and others. This is really cool indeed
        </p>
        <p>
            This, apparently will continue on for the course of this program. Most definitely, this page and article
            will get more robust and elegant, when we add more bells and whistles to what we are doing now. I am truly
            excited at how this will evolve into something we may have never encountered before.
        </p>

        <h2>Class Takeaway Practice Oct 7</h2>
        <p>
            We shall continue on later to populate this field as further insights and inspiration is gained.
        </p>

        <h2>Class Takeaway future...</h2>
        <p>
            We shall insert more content as time passes
        </p>

        <h2>Class Takeaway future(TBD)</h2>
        <p>
            More content with time
        </p>
