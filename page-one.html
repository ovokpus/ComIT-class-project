    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        The significance of oil and natural gas in modern civilization is well known. Nevertheless, like most
        production
        activities, oil and gas production processes generate large volumes of liquid waste. Oilfield wastewater or
        produced
        water contains various organic and inorganic components. Discharging produced water can pollute surface and
        underground
        water and soil.

    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2><a id="section-one"/>
    <p>
        I would like to express my sincere appreciation and regards to the Academic staff of the Bachelor of Applied
        Petroleum Engineering Technology (BAPT) program, in the McPhail School of Energy of SAIT. My Instructors who
        taught me various courses are all unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Special thanks go to Al Bernal, the Practicum Coordinator and Martin McDonald, the Academic Chair of the BAPT
        program. They afforded me timely advice, guidance and support, which ultimately led to my successful completion
        of the Practicum requirements of the BAPT program.
    </p>
    <p>
        All my classmates and colleagues I studied and worked with also made my BAPT experience indeed a memorable one.
        My learning experience in all will surely go a long way to provide the much needed basic foundation for my oil
        and gas career in Western Canada. I also seize this opportunity to express my profound feeling of appreciation
        to my Supervisors and team members in United Safety Ltd. I truly appreciate their help and strong team spirit in
        the duration of the turnaround project jobs we did together. I am grateful for the opportunity afforded me to
        make an entry into the Oil and Gas world.
