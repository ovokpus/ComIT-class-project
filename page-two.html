    <h2>Synopsis of my previous role at United Safety</h2><a id="section-two"/>
    <p>
        I was an active part of the United Safety workforce as a Safety Watch. My job role allows me to perform various
        activities such as Confined Space Entry and monitoring, Fire and Spark Watch duties, Breathing Air Bottle
        supervision, Gas Testing and Area Atmospheric Monitoring. I also participate in emergency alerts, as well as
        emergency planning and response, as well as Job Hazards Assessment and Control.
